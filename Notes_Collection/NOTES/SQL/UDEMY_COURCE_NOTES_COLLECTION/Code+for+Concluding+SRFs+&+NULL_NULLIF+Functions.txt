NVL = NVL() is used for replacing null with some meaningfull value....

select ename, job, sal, NVL(comm, 0)
from emp
where empno in (7839, 7698, 7566, 7654)   //---here NVL(comm , 0) function contains comm value which is an integer, so to be replace value/2nd argument should also be an integer

select ename, job, sal, NVL(to_char(comm), 'No Data Found')
from emp
where empno in (7839, 7698, 7566, 7654) //---here to_char(comm) is used to convert the comm value in string format....then NVL is used in order to use the 2nd argument as String 


select ename, length(ename) from emp


select ename, length(ename), NULLIF(length(ename), 5) from emp //---NULLIF(arg1,arg2)...NULLIF() returns null/empty cell if both the arg1 and arg2 are equal


select ename, length(ename), nvl(NULLIF(length(ename), 5), 'length is 5') from emp /* Gives "invalid number" error */


select ename, length(ename), nvl(NULLIF(to_char(length(ename)), to_char(5)), 'length is 5') from emp 

/*

select ename , length(ename) as "Ename Length", NVL(to_char(nullif(length(ename) , 5)) , 'Length is 5') as "Length Check" from emp; // it works

*/


select ename, length(ename), nvl(NULLIF(to_char(length(ename)), to_char(5)), 'length is 5') as result, sal from emp 
where sal > 2000
